			Only REAL GAMERS know... fuck stop with the REAL GAMER thing! Anyways if you're not in the know about the emulation community I'll inform you that Nintendo has successfully sued Yuzu, the company behind a Nintendo Switch emulator. Now Personally I don't use a Switch Emulator because well the console is currently out and I'll buy games that are available and distributed by the developers. My issue is with the shut down of Yuzu's other emulator Citra, a 3DS emulator. Now, I DO use Citra because the 3DS is a discontinued Console and the creators of the games on it don't profit from me buying the games second hand for jacked-up prices. The online emulation community is up in arms about the shut down calling Nintendo Greedy so I decided to throw some cash in my 3DS to symbolize that.
