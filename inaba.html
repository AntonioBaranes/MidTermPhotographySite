			Only REAL GAMERS know what I'm talking about here! Nah I'm fucking with you you don't have to be a REAL GAMER to know and you can still be a REAL GAMER if you don't. Who am I to gatekeep. Anyway this is a Persona 4 reference. The game takes place in a foggy town called Inaba and considering I just played it recently, when I walked out my appartment on a foggy day I was just like "OMG it's like Inaba out here" and decided to take a photo to commemorate the moment.
