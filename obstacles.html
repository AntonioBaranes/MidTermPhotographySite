		<p class="aboutsmaller">So yet again I'm on one of my silly goofy walks where I wave my camera around and disturb the public when suddenly I see this pretty cathedral looking building. Well damn I got this camera might as well catch a picture right? WRONG! Every single time I wanted to take a nice shot of the building the damn tree branches were in the way. This photo is a demonstration of the frustration I recieve from the obstacles in my path. But in the end I still liked the picture so I guess it's worth pushing through sometimes or something. </p></div>
