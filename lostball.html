			This is a photo I took in Prospect Park a while ago. I remember I was on the phone with Sam when I took it as we were making plans for her birthday and Valentines day. I don't know why I like this photo so much. I think a part of it is how the ball is the only bit of actual color in this photo or maybe how the branches are trying to cover it. It gives me a sense of individuality that we sometimes forget we have. It reminds me that we can all stand out by being our own unique and authentic selfs.
