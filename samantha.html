		<p class="aboutsmaller2">So that's my awesome girlfriend Samantha! We've been dating for almost 4 years so like... fuck I'm getting old. She goes to college in the middle of nowhere Pennsylvania so we don't see eachother that often. When we do it's always the best. Long distance is rough but seeing her in person always makes it worth it. In this photo we were getting ready to attend an event together so we were getting ourselves all pretty. We had a great time that night. I wish that night was every night. I love you Sam!</p></div>
