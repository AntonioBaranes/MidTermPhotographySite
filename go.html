		<p class="aboutsmaller">So I was walking down the street and I hipshot my camera straight up and got this shot of a green light. I think I just really like how I got this semi-decent shot of an actual thing without pointing the camera at it haha. Also let this serve as a reminder to get up and go do the things you have to do beacuse I really have to go do that... Wait! This is just like the last post but with the opposite message... I guess I just have too much to do :(</p></div>
