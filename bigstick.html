			Soooooo it was a certain puppy's birthday!!! That's my dog teo he's the fucking best boy you'll ever see in your God Damm life. That adorable sack of fur turned 5 and he's brought me the happiest 5 years of my life. The thing I miss the most about home is HIM. He enjoys laying on the ground and chewing branches, toys, and rubber balls. He's a pretty lazy boy just like me which is why I think he's the perfect boy for me!
