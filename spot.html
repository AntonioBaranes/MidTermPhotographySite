			This is the Atlantic Shopping Center right by the Barcley Center on Atlantic Ave. The first time my girlfriend Sam came to visit me in Brooklyn we got Cold Stone Ice Cream for way to much money and ate it there. This is also the same mall my dad would take me and my brother when we were kids visiting him in his place in Brooklyn. I distincly remember the bridge the connects the target to the rest of the mall and remember being hit by a nostalgia wave when I passed through it.
